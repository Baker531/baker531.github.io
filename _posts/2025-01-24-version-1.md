Version 1 of Asteroids ahoy! But sadly, Asteroids Plus has
hit a variety of speed bumps. Sad, I know. The problem is
a very persistent bug. It crashes at the beginning of the game
because of two errors:
```
Uncaught TypeError: 'caller', 'callee', and 'arguments' properties may not be accessed on strict mode functions or the arguments objects for calls to them

and
```

```
If anyone can come up with a solution, please, *please*, ***please*** either create an issue on Github, or send me an email (signupcat@protonmail.com). Yes, I know, not really a fitting email address, but whatever.

I have a temporary solution, however. Weirdly, the debug mode works just fine,
but run and compile for HTML5 doesn't. So I copy-pasted the code into the old code 
and minified it. It works for now, but it really needs to get better. So again, 
it would really be appreciated if you could help. 

And sorry for the popups. It's the debug window of GameMaker.
