## About me
I'm 12, homeschooled and I like coding. I plan to make a website for our homeschool group soon. My big project is [Asteroids Plus](https://baker531.github.io/asteroids). There's an online version and a Windows version.

<!-- ## About me
bI'm homeschooled and 12. Kind of straddling I code stuff. I have two computers, a 2015 iMac and a 2015 Macbook Pro. It would sound like I love Macs then. But I don't *really* like them. They're okay. Problem is, the hardware for Macs are awfully overpriced and slow. The specs for my computers are nearly identical. They both support and run MacOS Montery (12). They both have 8gb of DDR3 RAM. They both have a hard drive. A dual-core CPU. The iMac has a bigger screen and storage, and a slightly faster integrated GPU (Intel HD Graphics 6000 (iMac) vs 6100 (laptop)). My next computer will be a custom PC. Way cheaper, way faster. I also love electronics and soccer. I'd love to make the world's best coding language and OS. That's a bit about me. Oh, and I'm making an Asteroids game. The website is [here](https://baker531.github.io/asteroids). I recently used Apple Bootcamp to install Windows on my Mac, and I love it. Mainly the performance. -->
